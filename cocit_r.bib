In this study we compare the accuracies of cluster solutions of a large corpus of 2,153,769 recent articles from the biomedical literature (2004–2008) using four similarity approaches: co-citation analysis, bibliographic coupling, direct citation, and a bibliographic coupling-based citation-text hybrid approach. Each of the four approaches can be considered a way to represent the research front in biomedicine, and each is able to successfully cluster over 92\% of the corpus. Accuracies are compared using two metrics—within-cluster textual coherence as defined by the Jensen-Shannon divergence, and a concentration measure based on the grant-to-article linkages indexed in MEDLINE. Of the three pure citation-based approaches, bibliographic coupling slightly outperforms co-citation analysis using both accuracy measures; direct citation is the least accurate mapping approach by far. The hybrid approach improves upon the bibliographic coupling results in all respects. We consider the results of this study to be robust given the very large size of the corpus, and the specificity of the accuracy measures used.},

In this article, we address the issues of consistency, transparency, relevance and demand by using a model of science consisting of 91,726 topics (or research options) that contain over 58 million documents. We present a new indicator of topic prominence – a measure of visibility, momentum and, ultimately, demand. We assign over \$203 billion of project-level funding data from STAR METRICS® to individual topics in science, and show that the indicator of topic prominence, explains over one-third of the variance in current (or future) funding by topic. We also show that highly prominent topics receive far more funding per researcher than topics that are not prominent. Implications of these results for research planning and portfolio analysis by institutions and researchers are emphasized.},

We find that large, multidisciplinary journals are over-represented in this set of 30 journals, leading us to conclude that, within a discipline, citation distributions are lognormal.

	abstract = {[Pareto, Zipf and numerous subsequent investigators of inverse power distributions have often represented their findings as though their data conformed to a power law form for all ranges of the variable of interest. I refer to this ideal case as a strong inverse power law (SIPL). However, many of the examples used by Pareto and Zipf, as well as others who have followed them, have been truncated data sets, and if one looks more carefully in the lower range of values that was originally excluded, the power law behavior usually breaks down at some point. This breakdown seems to fall into two broad cases, called here (1) weak and (2) false inverse power laws (WIPL and FIPL, resp.). Case 1 refers to the situation where the sample data fit a distribution that has an approximate inverse power form only in some upper range of values. Case 2 refers to the situation where a highly truncated sample from certain exponential-type (and in particular, "lognormal-like") distributions can convincingly mimic a power law. The main objectives of this paper are (a) to show how the discovery of Pareto-Zipf-type laws is closely associated with truncated data sets; (b) to elaborate on the categories of strong, weak and false inverse power laws; and (c) to analyze FIPLs in some detail. I conclude that many, but not all, Pareto-Zipf examples are likely to be FIPL finite mixture distributions and that there are few genuine instances of SIPLs.]},

  abstract = {Research which explores unchartered waters has a high potential for major impact but also carries a higher uncertainty of having impact. Such explorative research is often described as taking a novel approach. This study examines the complex relationship between pursuing a novel approach and impact. Viewing scientific research as a combinatorial process, we measure novelty in science by examining whether a published paper makes first-time-ever combinations of referenced journals, taking into account the difficulty of making such combinations. We apply this newly developed measure of novelty to all Web of Science research articles published in 2001 across all scientific disciplines. We find that highly novel papers, defined to be those that make more (distant) new combinations, deliver high gains to science: they are more likely to be a top 1\% highly cited paper in the long run, to inspire follow-on highly cited research, and to be cited in a broader set of disciplines and in disciplines that are more distant from their ``home'' field. At the same time, novel research is also more risky, reflected by a higher variance in its citation performance. We also find strong evidence of delayed recognition of novel papers as novel papers are less likely to be top cited when using short time-windows. In addition, we find that novel research is significantly more highly cited in ``foreign'' fields but not in their ``home'' field. Finally, novel papers are published in journals with a lower Impact Factor, compared with non-novel papers, ceteris paribus. These findings suggest that science policy, in particular funding decisions which rely on bibliometric indicators based on short-term citation counts and Journal Impact Factors, may be biased against ``high risk/high gain'' novel research. The findings also caution against a mono-disciplinary approach in peer review to assess the true value of novel research.},

We study the impact of this choice on the ranking of 500 universities in the 2013 edition of the Leiden Ranking in two cases. First, we compare a Web of Science (WoS) journal-level classification system, consisting of 236 subject categories, and a publication-level algorithmically constructed system, denoted G8, consisting of 5,119 clusters. The result is that the consequences of the move from the WoS to the G8 system using the Top 1\% citation impact indicator are much greater than the consequences of this move using the Top 10\% indicator. Second, we compare the G8 classification system and a publication-level alternative of the same family, the G6 system, consisting of 1,363 clusters. The result is that, although less important than in the previous case, the consequences of the move from the G6 to the G8 system under the Top 1\% indicator are still of a large order of magnitude.},

  abstract = {Community detection is often used to understand the structure of large and complex networks. One of the most popular algorithms for uncovering community structure is the so-called Louvain algorithm. We show that this algorithm has a major defect that largely went unnoticed until now: the Louvain algorithm may yield arbitrarily badly connected communities. In the worst case, communities may even be disconnected, especially when running the algorithm iteratively. In our experimental analysis, we observe that up to 25\% of the communities are badly connected and up to 16\% are disconnected. To address this problem, we introduce the Leiden algorithm. We prove that the Leiden algorithm yields communities that are guaranteed to be connected. In addition, we prove that, when the Leiden algorithm is applied iteratively, it converges to a partition in which all subsets of all communities are locally optimally assigned. Furthermore, by relying on a fast local move approach, the Leiden algorithm runs faster than the Louvain algorithm. We demonstrate the performance of the Leiden algorithm for several benchmark and real-world networks. We find that the Leiden algorithm is faster than the Louvain algorithm and uncovers better partitions, in addition to providing explicit guarantees.},

  abstract = {In 1965, Price foresaw the day when a citation-based taxonomy of science and technology would be delineated and correspondingly used for science policy. A taxonomy needs to be comprehensive and accurate if it is to be useful for policy making, especially now that policy makers are utilizing citation-based indicators to evaluate people, institutions and laboratories. Determining the accuracy of a taxonomy, however, remains a challenge. Previous work on the accuracy of partition solutions is sparse, and the results of those studies, although useful, have not been definitive. In this study we compare the accuracies of topic-level taxonomies based on the clustering of documents using direct citation, bibliographic coupling, and co-citation. Using a set of new gold standards\textemdash{}articles with at least 100 references\textemdash{}we find that direct citation is better at concentrating references than either bibliographic coupling or co-citation. Using the assumption that higher concentrations of references denote more accurate clusters, direct citation thus provides a more accurate representation of the taxonomy of scientific and technical knowledge than either bibliographic coupling or co-citation. We also find that discipline-level taxonomies based on journal schema are highly inaccurate compared to topic-level taxonomies, and recommend against their use.},

Other important factors are number of references, language, journal category, and journal influence.},

  abstract = {The citation counts are increasingly used to assess the impact on the scientific community of publications produced by a researcher, an institution or a country. There are many institutions that use bibliometric indicators to steer research policy and for hiring or promotion decisions. Given the importance that counting citations has today, the aim of the work presented here is to show how citations are distributed within a scientific area and determine the dependence of the citation count on the article features. All articles referenced in the Web of Science in 2004 for Biology \& Biochemistry, Chemistry, Mathematics and Physics were considered. We show that the distribution of citations is well represented by a double exponential-Poisson law. There is a dependence of the mean citation rate on the number of co-authors, the number of addresses and the number of references, although this dependence is a little far from the linear behaviour. For the relation between the mean impact and the number of pages the dependence obtained was very low. For Biology \& Biochemistry and Chemistry we found a linear behaviour between the mean citation per article and impact factor and for Mathematics and Physics the results obtained are near to the linear behaviour.},
