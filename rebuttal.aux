\@writefile{lot}{\contentsline {table}{\numberline {1}{\ignorespaces The disciplinary compositions of the three analytical datasets in our manuscript ap: applied physics, imm: immunology, and metab: metabolism were analyzed for the years, 1985, 1995, and 2005 using the Web of Science research area categorizations of \emph  {lsb: life sciences and biology, ps: physical sciences, tech: technology, ss: social sciences, and ah: arts \& humanities}. Both publications (pubs) and cited references (refs) were analyzed. The data show that while publications closely track their most similar research area, references have a greater cross disciplinary content--especially in the applied physics dataset but also for the other two. }}{7}}

Data are shown for the applied physics (18,305), immunology (21,917), metabolism (97,405) and WoS (476,288) networks for 1995; numbers in parentheses are the count of publications in each network. Subfigures (a) and (b): the x-axis show publications classified into percentile groups based on citation counts (e.g., Top 1 indicates those publications in the top 1\%) and the y-axis shows the percent of publications in each set that are HC or HN. Based on the selected background network, z-scores are computed for each disciplinary network; thus, \emph  {imm} denotes the immunology network with immunology z-scores and \emph  {imm\_wos} denotes the immunology network with z-scores from WoS z-scores. }}{9}}
