\begin{abstract}
Citation analysis of the scientific literature has been used to study and define disciplinary boundaries, to trace the dissemination of knowledge, and to estimate impact. Co-citation, the frequency with which pairs of publications are cited, provides insight into how documents relate to each other and across fields. Co-citation analysis has been used to characterize combinations of prior work as conventional or innovative and to derive features of highly cited publications. Given the organization of science into disciplines, a key question is the sensitivity of such analyses to frame of reference. Our study examines this question using  semantically-themed citation networks. We observe that trends reported to be true across the scientific literature do not hold for focused citation networks, and we conclude that co-citation analysis requires a contextual perspective.

\section{Introduction}
Citation and network analysis of  scientific literature reveals information on semantic relationships between publications, collaboration between scientists, and the practice of citation itself~\citep{garfield_citation_1955,de_solla_price_networks_1965,newman_structure_2001,Shi:2010:CHI:1816123.1816131,patience_pmid28560354}. Co-citation, the frequency with which two documents are cited together in other documents provides additional insights, including the identification of semantically related documents, fields, ideas, and specializations in science~\citep{small_co-citation_1973,marshakova-shaikevich_co-citation_1973,boyack_co-citation_2010}. 

\citep{uzzi_atypical_2013} used a novel approach for co-citation analysis of 17.9 million articles and their cited references from the Web of Science (WoS)  to characterize a subset of highly cited articles with respect to both novel and conventional combinations of prior research. Observed co-citation frequencies, mapped to journals, were computed across the dataset and normalized (shifted and scaled) to expected values generated by Monte Carlo simulations under a random graph model. These normalized journal pair frequencies were termed \emph{z-scores} (Materials and Methods). Thus, every article was associated with multiple z-scores corresponding with the journal pairs represented by its citations. For each article, positional statistics of these z-scores were calculated to describe conventionality: high conventionality (HC) if the median z-score for an article was greater than the median of median z-scores of all articles and low conventionality for the converse (LC). Similarly,  an article was deemed to have high novelty (HN) if the tenth percentile of its z-scores  was negative and low novelty (LN) for the converse. Accordingly, each article was labeled with respect to conventionality and novelty, e.g, HCHN (denoting that the article exhibits high conventionality and high novelty), with all four combinations being possible. 
\citep{uzzi_atypical_2013} observed that HCHN articles were twice as likely to be highly cited, suggesting that novel combinations of ideas flavoring a body of conventional thought were a recipe for impact across the scientific literature. 

Key to Uzzi {\em et al.}, however, is their random graph model and its underlying assumptions. A careful examination of the model (as defined by the Monte Carlo simulation) reveals that all substitutions of references are equiprobable, which means that a reference in an article can be substituted by any other reference randomly chosen from those published in the same year, irrespective of subject matter and citation count. For example, the model permits substitution of a reference in quantum physics with equal probability by a reference in classical literature, evolutionary biology, or anthropology. Such substitutions poorly model documented citation behavior~\citep{wallace_lariviere_gingras_2012,moed_measuring_2010,klavans_research_2017,garfield_1979}. (Possibly insert reference to Sitaram's investigation here.) In addition, under this random model,  a reference cited over 100 times in a given year is selected with the same probability as a reference cited only once, which is inconsistent with the actual frequency of citation and also the power law or lognormal distributions observed in citations ~\citep{stringer_statistical_2010,perline_strong_2005}.  Accordingly, the expected value calculations generated by the \citep{uzzi_atypical_2013} simulations and used in characterizing journal pairs in terms of conventionality and novelty  can be reasonably questioned on grounds of model mis-specification. 

A follow-up study by \citep{boyack_vs_uzzi_2014} explored the impact of discipline and journal effects on the definition of conventionality and novelty.  While their study had some methodological differences from \citep{uzzi_atypical_2013} in the use of Scopus data and a $\chi^2$ calculation for the expected number of journal pair citations, Boyack and Klavans find the same basic trend that HCHN is more probably in highly cited papers. However, they note that ``only 64.4\%  of  243  WoS  subject  categories'' in the Uzzi {\em et al.} study met the criterion of having the highest probability of hit papers in the HCHN category.  Further, they observed that journals vary widely in terms of size and influence and that 20 journals accounted for nearly 15\% of co-citations in their measurements. Lastly, they noted that three multidisciplinary journals accounted for 9.4\% of all atypical combinations, suggesting strong effects from both disciplines and journals that were not reported by Uzzi et al. 

Despite different methods used to generate expected values, both \citep{uzzi_atypical_2013} and \citep{boyack_vs_uzzi_2014}  measured observed frequencies across the scientific literature without disciplinary constraints and subsequently used normalized frequencies to examine disciplinary subsets. In contrast, we chose instead to first construct semantically related sets of documents (disciplinary networks) and to measure observed and expected frequencies within these networks. (or cite Sitaram's statistics here so as to add specificity to this sentence, which could have this appended to it: ``consistent with researchers' patterns of citing predominantly work from their own field.  This doesn't preclude citations from outside of the discipline of focus, but constrains the random substitutions to more plausibly related literature.'')

Accordingly, we used keyword searches of the scientific literature to create three citation networks themed around broad search terms. Within these disciplinary frameworks, we calculated expected values using a random graph model that accounted for existing citation frequencies and an efficient Monte Carlo simulation algorithm that permitted a substantially greater number of simulations. We hypothesized that our approach would  reduce model misspecification and better simulate citation practice, in turn leading to different and more relevant conclusions. Our study on these semantically-themed citation networks reveals significantly different patterns of conventionality and novelty between  citation networks and disciplines that challenges the conclusion that HCHN articles have a greater probability of being represented in highly cited publications. 
Instead, we conclude that conventional thought as commonly defined in our study, 
in \citep{uzzi_atypical_2013}, and  \citep{boyack_vs_uzzi_2014}, is more likely to drive higher citations (in the disciplinary networks we studied).
 \emph{these are just filler conclusions that must be carefully rewritten and added to- need Jim's conclusions to be stated here.}.

\section{Materials and Methods}
\emph{Bibliographic data} We have previously developed ERNIE, an open source knowledge platform into which we parse the Web of Science (WoS) Core Collection~\citep{Keserci371955}. WoS data stored in ERNIE spans the period 1900-2019 and consists of over 72 million publications. For this study, we generated an analytical dataset from years 1985 to 2005 from ERNIE. The total number of publications in this dataset was just over 25 million publications (25,134,073).  For each of these years, we further restricted analysis to those of type Article. Since WoS data also contains incomplete references or references that point at other indexes,  we also considered only those references for which there were complete records (Table 1). For example, WoS data for year 2005 contained 1,753,174 publications, which after restricting to type Article and considering only those references described above resulted in 916,573 publications, 6,095,594 unique references (set of references), and 17,167,347 total references (multiset of references). Given consistent trends in the data, we analyzed the two boundary years (1985 and 2005) and the mid-point (1995) performing 1,000 simulations for each dataset. \\
\emph{Disciplinary datasets} We constructed three disciplinary datasets based on keyword searches. (i) immunology (ii) metabolism (iii) applied physics. For the first two, rooted in biomedical research, we searched Pubmed for the term `immunology' or `metabolism' in the years 1985, 1995, and 2005. Pubmed IDs (pmids) returned were matched to WoS IDs (wos\_ids) and used to retrieve relevant articles. For the applied physics dataset, we directly searched article level labels in WoS for `applied physics'. \\
\emph{Normalization of observed and expected values} Building upon prior work~\cite{uzzi_atypical_2013}, all ${n \choose 2}$ reference pairs were generated for each publication, where $n$ is the number of cited references in the publication. These reference pairs were then mapped to the journals they were published in using ISSN numbers,  creating journal pairs. Where multiple ISSN numbers exist for a journal, the most frequently used one in the WoS was assigned to the journal. In addition, publications containing fewer than two references were discarded. Journal pair frequencies were summed up across the dataset to create observed frequencies $(F_{obs})$. In contrast to the preceding study~\citep{uzzi_atypical_2013}, we generated 1,000 rather than 10 null models for each dataset by randomly shuffling references while preserving the number of publications, the number of references in each publication, and the frequency with which these references were cited within the year of interest. Expected values $(F_{exp})$ were generated by averaging the result of 1,000 simulations. z-scores were calculated for each journal-pair using the formula $(F_{obs} - F_{exp})/\sigma$ where $\sigma$
 is the standard deviation of the frequencies generated by simulation. (Do we need a comment here that while we are using the term z-score, we do not imply that these are related to a normal distribution. Rather, we are using the terminology from Uzzi et al.) As a result of these calculations, each publication becomes associated with a set of z-scores corresponding to the journal pairs derived from pairwise combinations of its cited references and positional statistics (quantiles) of z-scores were calculated for each publication. Publications were also labeled according to conventionality and novelty. (i) HC if the median z-score exceeded the median of median z-scores for all publications. LC if the median z-score was equal to or less than the median of median z-scores for all publications (ii) HN if the tenth percentile of z-scores for a publication was less than zero. LN if the tenth percentile of z-scores for a publication was greater than zero. 
 
We investigated multiple definitions of hit articles, as did Uzzi et al., with hits defined as the 1\%, 2\%, 5\%, and 10\% top-cited articles.  Do we want to report on the percentile being used for novelty at both the 1 and 10th percentile, or just focus on the 10th percentile?

\section{Results}
\subsection{Chacko} In our study, we also use a Monte Carlo approach to simulate under a random graph model. A  principal consideration, however, was to restrict model misspecification arising from disciplinarily irrelevant references. We addressed this consideration by restricting random substitutions to only those references in the disciplinary network being studied. We estimated model misspecification by measuring the Kullback-Leibler (K-L) Divergence~\citep{kullback_information_1951} between observed and simulated frequencies for the set of journals common to both a disciplinary network and the WoS superset (Table 3). The results indicate that simulations under our model consistently have a lower K-L divergence compared to simulations that draw from the WoS superset and its attendant substitutions that are ectopic with respect to field and discipline (Introduction).

\begin{table}[ht]
\caption{Measuring Model Misspecification. For the set of journal pairs in common between a disciplinary network and the full WoS dataset, Kullback-Leibler (K-L) divergences
between empirical and simulated journal pair frequencies were computed for the years 1985, 1995, and 2005 for the three disciplinary datasets (applied\_physics, immunology, and metabolism) using either the disciplinary network as background or the WoS superset (all\_wos) to generate the null model (Background). K-L divergence was calculated using the R seewave package with a base (logarithm) of 2. The ratio between the K-L divergence for disciplinary networks versus the full WoS ranges from 1.96 to 2.77 and is greater than 2.0 for eight out of nine cases, strongly suggesting that simulations that constrain substitutions to the given disciplinary network better model the observed data.}

\subsection{Bradley}
Figure \ref{fig:scatter} shows that the z-scores for the same journal pair can be positive (negative) when computed with respect to one data set but be negative (positive) for another data set. The journal-pair z-scores in Figure \ref{fig:scatter} have consistent signs for both Immunology and WoS data sets in 71.4\% of the instances and different signs for 28.6\% of the journal pairs. A negative journal pair z-score in one context increases the likelihood that articles citing it will be deemed to be novel while articles citing it in another context, where the journal pair z-score is positive, are less likely to be classified as novel and possibly more likely to be classified as conventional. Figure \ref{fig:scatter} reflects that the WoS data set has approximately 44,000 fewer negative z-scores than does the immunology data set, which contributes to its significantly lower percentage of high-novelty articles as shown in Figure \ref{fig:scatter}.

The LNHC category often had the highest hit rate for the immunology dataset for various parameter settings with the HCHN category having the highest hit rate in other cases: metabolism results are similar.

Figure \ref{fig:Fig2}, Panels (a) and (b), compares hit rates for the four categories among the Immunology, Applied Physics, and WoS datasets for 1995: the hit rate is defined as the number of hit articles in each category divided by the number of articles in the category. We evaluated the statistical significance of the categorical hit rates using multiple methods, some of which we describe here.  Our first test was based on the null hypotheses that hits were distributed randomly among the four categories with uniform probability in proportion to the number of articles in each category. Using a Chi-Square Goodness of Fit test, rejecting the null hypothesis in favor of the alternate hypothesis supports a non-uniform dispersion of hits: that is, some of the four categories are individually associated with higher than expected, or lower than expected hit rates. The null hypothesis was rejected at a $p<0.001$ in all cases in  Figure \ref{fig:Fig2}, with the exception of the immunology and applied datasets where hit articles are designated as the top 1\% of articles: valid tests were not possible in those instances due to too few expected hits. The null hypothesis was rejected with $p<0.001$ for all valid tests for all parameter settings, all datasets, and all years: hypotheses tests were valid in 73 of 96 instances. We conclude that it is likely that the distribution of hits among categories is not uniform but, rather, hit rates vary among the categories in all datasets. (Should we insert a table with all statistical results?)

We computed hit rates for the WoS dataset, which mirrored Uzzi et al.'s results whereby the largest hit rates were for the HNHC category, despite our methodological improvement of sampling citations in proportion to their frequency. We found contrary results in the 1995 immunology dataset where articles in the LNHC category often had the greatest hit rates, as reflected in Table \ref{Tab:HitRate} and Figure \ref{fig:Fig2}.  Across all year's data, all datasets, and all parameter settings, the highest hit rates in the immunology datasets were sometimes in the LNHC category and sometimes in the HNHC category. The metabolism hit rates reflected this same pattern. The greatest hit rates for the applied physics data were often in the HNLC category as reflected in Table \ref{Tab:HitRate} and Figure \ref{fig:Fig2}, and otherwise in the HNHC category. We conclude that Uzzi et al.'s finding of high hit rates in the HNHC category does not hold generally for disciplinary-based datasets and that novel citation patterns are not always indicative of impactful research, as was the case with immunology. Furthermore, the categories displaying the greatest hit rate vary with parameter settings and with the year. The lack of stable results across parameter settings suggests that parameters must be selected judiciously.

We also tested the explanatory power of each framework dimension by classifying articles as Low Novelty (LN) or High Novelty (HN) and, separately, as having Low Conventionality (LC) or High Conventionality (HC).  We tested the null hypothesis that hits are distributed between LN and HN (LC and HC) in proportion to the total number of articles assigned to those categories.  That null hypothesis was rejected for the WoS data along both dimensions. Consistent with previous analysis, hit articles were overrepresented in the HC category in every instance of WoS data at a $p<0.001$ and hit articles were overrepresented in the HN category at a $p<0.001$ in all but two cases.  The p-values, in those cases, were 0.002 and 0.007.  Hits in the immunology and metabolism data were overrepresented in the HC category with the same statistical significance as for WoS. The relationship of novelty with hits in the immunology and metabolism data differed dramatically from the WoS, however, with statistically significant findings of hit articles being sometimes overrepresented in the LN category, and sometimes being underrepresented.  Of the 12 tests for applied physics, the statistical significance supporting a positive relationship between hit articles and HN were all $p<0.10$, and 10 of 12 were $p<0.05$.  These tests also indicated strong support for the relationship between LN and hit articles in applied physics in a limited number of tests, with $p<0.10$ in 5 of 12 instances and $p < 0.05$ in 3 of 12 instances. These results suggest that (1) both conventionality and novelty are strongly related to hits in the WoS, (2) the conventionality dimension is strongly related with hits in immunology and metabolism and novelty is not, (3) novelty is more strongly related with hits in applied physics than is conventionality. More generally, we find that the dimensions most strongly related with hit articles vary across disciplines and between disciplinary and broad data sets. 


\section{Discussion}

We conclude that Uzzi et al.'s finding of high hit rates in the HNHC category does not hold generally for all datasets and that novel citation patterns are not always indicative of impactful research.

The z-scores that change sign across datasets is either contradictory or an acceptable variation due to the difference in reference sets. We contend that it is the former because the inappropriate substitution of citations with those from disciplines that are implausible and because the observed citation frequencies are ignored. That fewer z-scores are negative in the WoS dataset relative to the immunology dataset may be directly due to the uniform sampling of references whereby many resulting journal pairs are never observed in the literature and so that the expected frequencies of those observed pairs have lower expected values, thus biasing their z-scores upward. In addition, treating citation as a set versus a multiset means that a random model will sample popular citations downward, thus further increasing their z-scores.

Contrary to Uzzi et al. we found the category displaying the highest hit rate to be sensitive to the experimental parameter settings, which included the percentage of articles deemed to be hits and the percentile of articles' z-score distributions that delineated between articles of low novelty and high novelty. Thus, with this lack of robustness, studies are faced with the necessity of defining which parameters are the best parameters to classify articles.

Many real-world systems operate as some sort of

transportation networks. Similar to brain networks, many of these
real-world networks display an efficient small-world organization, a

comparison of networks within the class of nervous systems, the field
of `comparative network analysis' examines commonalities and

\subsection{Jargon Samples in margin}
One common decision is between working (performing an employer-defined
task) and engaging in leisure (activities pursued for oneself). Working
leads to external rewards such as food and money; whereas leisure is
supposed to be intrinsically beneficial \jargon{Intrinsically beneficial}{The characteristic of
leisure that we enjoy most.} (otherwise one would not want to
engage in it).
%% \jargon has optional argument in square brackets where you can specify
%% the amount of extra space below where it would normally appear when

\begin{boxedtext}{Tools for comparison of networks} 
Going beyond the examination of shared topological features across
nervous systems, the generalized mathematical language of graph theory
also offers tools for the comparison of the organization of brain
networks to other classes of network studied by different scientific
disciplines. 

From $\mathcal{W}$, we can estimate the variability in the fluctuations of the functional connection between nodes $i$ and $j$ over time as:
\begin{equation}
s_{ij}=\sqrt{\frac{1}{T-L}\sum_{t=1}^{T-L+1}(W_{ij}(t) - m_{ij})}
\end{equation}
where $m_{ij}=\frac{1}{T-L+1}\sum_{t=1}^{T-L+1}W_{ij}(t)$ is the mean
dynamic functional connectivity over time. 

Many real-world systems operate as some sort of
interaction or communication network, including, for example, social
networks, gene regulatory networks, computer networks, and
transportation networks. Similar to brain networks, many of these
real-world networks display an efficient small-world organization, a
pronounced community structure with densely connected modules, as well
as the formation of hubs and rich clubs. Going beyond the
comparison of networks within the class of nervous systems, the field
of `comparative network analysis' examines commonalities and
differences across a range of network classes.
